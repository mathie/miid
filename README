	miid - Monitor the link state of Ethernet devices and attempt to
	bring up or down the interface when the link state changes.

I have a laptop with a built in Ethernet controller.  Sometimes it is plugged
into the Ethernet, sometimes it isn't.  Instead of trying to bring up the
interface every boot, just in case I am on a local network, I've opted to
bring it up manually when I actually do have a network connection.  It has
occurred to me though that the MII on the Ethernet controller knows well
enough when it has link state, so why don't I get it to do the job for me?

To get it working, put miid somewhere in your startup scripts.  Run
`miid --help` to find out the arguments.  Eventually, I might even write
a manpage.  You should be able to invoke a copy for each interface you
want to monitor.  Then, modify the rest of your networking setup so that
the devices you are monitoring aren't brought up automatically at boot.

(For example, in Debian, edit /etc/network/interfaces and remove the
"auto <dev>" directive.)

Next time you boot, plug in your network cable and the interface will brought
up.  Unplug the network cable and the interface will be brought back down
again.  Neat, huh?

Of course, this all assumes your Ethernet controller works with the
MII code in Linux. :-)  It works on my Sony Vaio, with the Intel ICH2
chipset.  I have reports of it hanging Apple TiBooks. :-)

The mii-reading code was inspired by Donald Becker's mii-diag (which you
can find at http://www.scyld.com/diag/index.html#mii-diag).

you use this and find it useful, let me know.  I require validation. :-)
